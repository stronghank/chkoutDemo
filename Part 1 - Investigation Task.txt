1. Request Token:
	The cvv length is wrong, the API reference for Tokens mentions that "The card verification value/code. 3 digits, except for American Express (4 digits)".
	So we can change the cvv from "1000" to a 3-digit number to make it work and get the token returned, or we can change the card number to an American Express card which uses 4 digits cvv to make the API work.

2. Payment request - token:
	The token is already used so it is invalid.
	Replace the token field with the one we generated from the previous 1. Request Token (https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/tokens) can make the API succeed with the status Authorized. 

3. Payment request - card:
	The length of the processing_channel_id is wrong, based on the regular expression ^(pc)_(\w{26})$ from API reference, it should be 26 characters after "pc_" instead of 28. 
	Delete the last 2 characters from processing_channel_id can make the API succeed with the status Authorized.

4. Refund request:
	The API failed due to 403 "Refund not allowed". I called the GET request https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_6nsdm4ovfzyedlgj2zji6l2aou and found the status was already in "Refunded".
	Change the payment_id to the one returned in 3. Payment request - card can make the API succeed with 202 Accepted and a returned action_id

5. Capture request:
	The API failed due to 403 "Capture not allowed". I called the GET request https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_von5dadyonvezn6uyx47v7jdoi and found the status was already in "Captured".
	In 3. Payment request - card, we can change the field capture from true to false, make the request to get a new payment_id. Then we use this payment_id to call the capture request again and can get 202 Accepted.
